## 2025-10-30

Based on Formbricks v4.1.0-rc

**Commits:**
- dea3a08fa (ci/change-workflows-for-getup) ci: customise GitHub workflows for GetUp deployment

### GitHub Workflows Trigger Changes
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml` (lines 3-8)
- `.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml` (lines 2-10)
- `.github/workflows/translation-check.yml` (lines 6-23)

**Changes:**

**chromatic.yml:**
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch
- Kept `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - run manually only"

**sonarqube.yml:**
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch
- Kept `workflow_dispatch`, `pull_request`, and `merge_group` triggers active
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - runs on PR only"

**translation-check.yml:**
- Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual execution
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch with path filters
- Kept `pull_request` trigger with path filters
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - run manually or on PR only"

**Reason:** Provide manual control over workflow execution and reduce unnecessary automatic runs on every push to main. All workflows remain functional via manual dispatch and PR validation workflows continue to run automatically. This aligns with GetUp's deployment strategy of controlled, manual deployments.

**Impact:** No automatic workflows run on push to main (chromatic, sonarqube, translation-check). PR validation workflows (test, lint, e2e) remain unchanged and continue to run automatically on pull requests.

### Docker Build System Changes
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `.github/actions/build-and-push-docker/action.yml` (lines 271-290)
- `.github/workflows/build-and-push-ecr.yml` (line 90)

**Changes:**
- Replaced `depot/build-push-action@636daae76684e38c301daa0c5eca1c095b24e780` (v1.14.0) with `docker/build-push-action@ca052bb54ab0790a636c9b5f226502c73d547a25` (v5.4.0)
- Removed Depot-specific parameters: `project: tw0fqmsx3c` and `token: ${{ env.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}`
- Changed platforms from `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to `linux/amd64` only
- Removed `DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN` from environment variables in both files

**Reason:** GetUp infrastructure uses standard Docker builds instead of Depot service. Simplified to single platform (amd64) for GetUp's deployment targets. Reduces external dependencies and costs while maintaining full ECR deployment compatibility.
