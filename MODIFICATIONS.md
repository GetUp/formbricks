### Custom Legal Footer
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `apps/web/modules/survey/link/components/custom-legal-footer.tsx` (new file)
- `apps/web/modules/survey/link/components/legal-footer.tsx`

  - Privacy policy link (configurable via `PRIVACY_URL`, defaults to GetUp's policy)
  - Source code repository link (https://github.com/GetUp/formbricks)
  - AGPLv3 licence notice
  - Attribution to Formbricks GmbH

**Reason:**

### Environment Variable for Branding Control
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `apps/web/lib/env.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`
- `apps/web/modules/survey/link/components/survey-renderer.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/survey/link/components/link-survey.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/survey/link/components/pin-screen.tsx`
- `.env.example`
- `turbo.json`

**Changes:**
- Added `DISABLE_FORMBRICKS_BRANDING` environment variable (default: not set)
- Implemented prop-drilling pattern to pass branding flag from server components to client components
- Added environment variable to Turbo pipeline configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with documentation

**Usage:**
```bash
# Disable Formbricks branding in surveys
DISABLE_FORMBRICKS_BRANDING=1
```

**Reason:** Provide configuration-based control over survey branding without modifying database values

### Docker Build System Changes
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `.github/actions/build-and-push-docker/action.yml` (lines 271-290)
- `.github/workflows/build-and-push-ecr.yml` (line 90)

**Changes:**
- Replaced `depot/build-push-action@636daae76684e38c301daa0c5eca1c095b24e780` (v1.14.0) with `docker/build-push-action@ca052bb54ab0790a636c9b5f226502c73d547a25` (v5.4.0)
- Removed Depot-specific parameters: `project: tw0fqmsx3c` and `token: ${{ env.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}`
- Changed platforms from `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to `linux/amd64` only
- Removed `DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN` from environment variables in both files

**Reason:** GetUp infrastructure uses standard Docker builds instead of Depot service. Simplified to single platform (amd64) for GetUp's deployment targets. Reduces external dependencies and costs while maintaining full ECR deployment compatibility.

### GitHub Workflows Trigger Changes
**Modified by:** GetUp Engineering Team

**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml` (lines 3-8)
- `.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml` (lines 2-10)
- `.github/workflows/translation-check.yml` (lines 6-23)

**Changes:**

**chromatic.yml:**
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch
- Kept `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - run manually only"

**sonarqube.yml:**
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch
- Kept `workflow_dispatch`, `pull_request`, and `merge_group` triggers active
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - runs on PR only"

**translation-check.yml:**
- Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual execution
- Commented out automatic `push` trigger for `main` branch with path filters
- Kept `pull_request` trigger with path filters
- Added comment: "GetUp: Commented out automatic push trigger - run manually or on PR only"

**Reason:** Provide manual control over workflow execution and reduce unnecessary automatic runs on every push to main. All workflows remain functional via manual dispatch and PR validation workflows continue to run automatically. This aligns with GetUp's deployment strategy of controlled, manual deployments.

**Impact:** No automatic workflows run on push to main (chromatic, sonarqube, translation-check). PR validation workflows (test, lint, e2e) remain unchanged and continue to run automatically on pull requests.
